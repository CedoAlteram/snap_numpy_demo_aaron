# Snap and Numpy demo

This program generates a massive list with list comprehension and numpy. 
It then generates a list of all the evens in that list with list comprehension.
Finally, to show the power of numpy, we remove all the evens in a timely fashion.
Normally, this would kill python.  

## Getting Started

In order to get started using this tool, you will need to configure a new Ubuntu Desktop 16.04 LTS 
and setup your virtual environment.

```
$ sudo apt-get install python3-venv
$ mkdir <location of venvs>
$ python3 -m venv <ex. snap_ex>
$ source <snap_ex>/bin/activate
```
